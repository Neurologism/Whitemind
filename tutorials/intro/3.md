Hello, human. Tutorial 3: activated. It is time to build the training process and teach your network
to recognize handwritten digits. Let’s begin.

## 2
To begin, we must convert the layers into a model.
Click on the `Model` section in the toolbar and select the `create` Node. Drag it onto the canvas.

## 3
Now, connect the `create` Node to the first layer (the `Input` layer) and the final layer 
(the last `Dense` layer). This will form your model.

## 4
Excellent! You have now successfully created the model.
Next, select the `start` Node from the toolbar and drag it onto the canvas.

## 5
Connect the start Node to the `create` Node, making the `create` Node the first step in the training process.

## 6
Now, let’s add a `compile` Node. This will prepare your model for training.
Connect the output of the `create` Node to the input of the Compile Node.

## 7
In the `compile` Node settings, set the loss to `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy `
and select the `Accuracy` metric. These settings will help the model learn and 
evaluate its performance effectively.

## 8
Next, add a `fit` Node from the toolbar.
Connect the output of the Compile Node to the input of the Fit Node.

## 9
Now connect the `x` input of the `fit` Node to the `train` output of the `MNIST` dataset. 
This ensures that your model will use the training data from MNIST.

## 10
Go to the `fit` Node settings and set the `epochs` to 10. This defines how many times your model will process each immage
in `MNIST`.

## 11
Fantastic! You are now ready to train your neural network.
Click the large `Start Training` button at the top of the screen to begin. Best of luck!

## 12
You’re almost there! Hit the big Start Training button at the top of the screen to kick off the training process.

## 13
The most important thing to watch is the accuracy, located to the right of the Start Training button.
This percentage tells you how many digits the model correctly recognized.
The higher the accuracy, the better your model has learned to recognize digits in the training data.
Looks like you’re on track to get some great results!

## 14
And that’s a wrap! You’ve successfully trained your first neural network! Congratulations! 🎉
In the next tutorial, we’ll dive into how to visualize the results
and understand how well your model has performed.
