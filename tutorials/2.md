Welcome back to round two! Last time we set up the basic structure of your network,
and now we're going to prepare it for the MNIST dataset. But first, let's introduce the dataset!

## 2
In the toolbar, click on the `Datasets` section. Look for the `MNIST` dataset 
and drag it onto the canvas.

## 3
The `MNIST` dataset is a collection of handwritten digits, divided into two parts: 
training data and testing data. You can access them from the right side of the dataset.

## 4
Before we can use `MNIST`, we need to make sure the network is ready.
First, we'll need to adjust the layers.

## 5
Click on the first Dense layer (the one below the Input layer). This will open the settings menu.

## 6
In the settings, change the `units` to 128. This defines how big the layer is.

## 7
Next, set the `activation` to ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit). This helps the network learn more
complex patterns.

## 8
Now, click on the second Dense layer. Set its `units` to 10. This is the number of
different digits the network will recognize (from 0 to 9).

## 9
Change the `activation` to Softmax. This will give us a probability distribution about
how likely each digit is in the image.

## 10
Great! Now, let’s configure the Input layer. Set its shape to [28, 28, 1]. 
This shape matches the size of the images in the MNIST dataset (28x28 pixels, 
with 1 color channel for grayscale images).

## 11 
Now that the layers are configured, let's make some changes to the network structure.
Remove the connection between the Input layer and the first Dense layer by clicking 
on the line and pressing the `Delete` key.

## 12
Nice work! Now, add a `Flatten` layer. This layer will convert the 2D image(28x28 pixels) into
a 1D array (784 pixels), which the network can process. Connect the `Flatten` layer to the 
first `Dense` layer.

## 13
Let's add a `Normalization` layer to make the image data more manageable for the network.
Now, connect from the `Input` layer to the `Normalization` layer and from the `Normalization` layer
to the `Flatten` layer.

## 14
You nailed it! Connect the `adapt` port of the `Normalization` layer 
to the `train` port of the `MNIST` dataset.

## 15
Congratulations! Your network is now fully configured and ready to process the MNIST dataset.
The next lesson will cover training the network and evaluating its performance.
