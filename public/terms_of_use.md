Last Updated: March 5, 2025

1. [Who we are](#who-we-are)

These Terms of Service outline our legal relationship with you and apply to your use of WhiteMind’s services.

When we say **“WhiteMind,”** **“we,”** **“us,”** or **“our,”** we’re referring to the owners of the WhiteMind service. <!--to **WhiteMind UG (haftungsbeschränkt)**, the company behind WhiteMind.-->

By **“services,”** we mean all WhiteMind offerings, including our website, apps, and any other services that link to these terms.

When we say **“you”** or **“your,”** we mean you as an individual. If you’re using our services on behalf of an organization (like your employer), you confirm that you have the authority to accept these terms on their behalf. In that case, **“you”** and **“your”** will refer to the organization.

Your use of our services is also subject to our **Privacy Policy**, which explains how we handle your data.

These rules help keep WhiteMind a great experience for everyone. If you believe someone is violating them, please report it to **info@whitemind.net**.

## Who we are

We provide services that help you learn the principles of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Our offerings may include access to software, interactive features, and educational content. Some products and services may be available for purchase.

## Age requirements and responsibility of parents and legal guardians

By using our services, you confirm that you are at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age required by the laws of your country.

If you meet your country’s minimum age to access our services but are not old enough to legally consent to these terms, your parent or legal guardian must agree to them on your behalf. Please ask them to review these terms with you.

If you are a parent or legal guardian and allow your child (who must meet the minimum age requirement) to use our services, you agree to these terms and accept responsibility for their activity, including any purchases they make.

## Account Registration and Security

To use our services on an ongoing basis, you must create a WhiteMind account by providing a username and password. In some cases, you may need to verify your account or provide additional information.

You are responsible for keeping your account secure. If you believe your account has been compromised, you must notify us immediately. If you use a password, it must be strong, and we strongly recommend that you use it exclusively for your WhiteMind account.

You must always provide accurate information and keep your account details up to date. We may assume that any communications received from your account or associated contact information were made by you, and that any purchases made using your account were authorized by you.

If you get locked out of your account, we will need to contact you through the email or phone number associated with it. If your account is compromised and you lose access to your email or phone number, we may not be able to restore your access.

You agree not to sell, lend, transfer, or license your account, username, or any other unique identifier without our prior written approval. We also reserve the right to delete, modify, or reclaim usernames or other identifiers as needed.

## Content in WhiteMind’s Services

### Your Content

When we say **“your content,”** we mean anything you add to our services, including text, links, photos, videos, documents, or other media. If we introduce new ways to add content in the future, those will be included too.

You are not required to add content to our services. If you choose to do so, you are responsible for ensuring you have the necessary rights, that your content complies with applicable laws, and that you can grant the licenses outlined in these terms. We do not take responsibility for your content or how others use it.

WhiteMind provides various ways for users to share content. Be mindful of where you post, understand the relevant permissions, and select the appropriate settings for your content.

Your content remains yours, but by using our services, you grant us a license to use it in connection with operating, developing, and improving WhiteMind. This includes the right to:

- **Use, copy, store, distribute, and communicate** your content in ways that support your use of our services. (For example, to store and display your content.)
- **Publish, publicly perform, or display** your content if you’ve chosen to make it visible to others. (For example, to recommend content to other users.)
- **Monitor, modify, translate, or reformat** your content. (For example, resizing images to fit different devices.)
- **Sublicense your content** as necessary to operate WhiteMind effectively. (For example, to store your content on cloud service providers.)

This license is **worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, and perpetual**.

We reserve the right to block, remove, or permanently delete content that violates our terms, policies, laws, or regulations, or that poses risks to WhiteMind or negatively impacts other users.

We welcome feedback on our services. By submitting feedback, you grant us a **perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable** license to use your feedback and any ideas derived from it **without restrictions, attribution, or compensation**.

### WhiteMind’s Content

Some content within our services belongs to us, including the design of our apps and websites, artwork, images, and written materials. You may use our software as outlined in these terms, but you may not use our trademarks, copyrights, or brand assets unless permitted with our prior written consent. We retain all intellectual property rights in our content.

### Other Content

Other users’ content may also appear on WhiteMind. You may not use their content without permission, unless allowed by law. This content belongs to them and does not necessarily reflect WhiteMind’s views. We do not endorse or verify the accuracy of content shared by users. While we strive to maintain a safe and positive environment, we cannot guarantee that you won’t encounter content you find objectionable. You agree that WhiteMind is not liable for any harm caused by such content.

If you believe content violates our policies, you may report it. We have the right—but not the obligation—to review reports and take action at our discretion.

### Third-Party Features and Content

WhiteMind may provide access to third-party websites, features, apps, or other content. This access is provided for convenience only, and we are not responsible for the content, services, or functionality of third-party resources.

## Software in WhiteMind’s Services

### License to Our Software

Some of our services may allow you to download client software. As long as you comply with these terms, we grant you a **worldwide, non-exclusive, personal, and non-transferable** license to download, install, and use the software **solely to access our services**.

You may not **copy, modify, create derivative works, distribute, sell, lease, or sublicense** our software or services. You also may not **reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code** unless permitted by law or with our written consent.

While we grant you this license, WhiteMind retains all intellectual property rights in our software and services.

### Third-Party Services

WhiteMind may provide access to third-party apps, or other features (“third-party services”). Your use of these services is optional and subject to the third party’s terms and policies.

Although third-party services must follow applicable policies, WhiteMind is not responsible for their content, security, or functionality. Before using any third-party services, you should review their terms and privacy policies.

## Copyright

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and expect our users to do the same. If you believe that content on WhiteMind infringes your copyright, you can contact us at **info@whitemind.net** for information on how to file a copyright complaint.

## WhiteMind’s Paid Services

The basic functionality of WhiteMind is free to use. However, certain features and products may be available for purchase.

## Restrictions on Your Use of WhiteMind's Services

When using WhiteMind’s services, you must comply with these terms, all applicable laws, and our policies. You should only use our services for authorized and acceptable purposes. Specifically, do not do, attempt to do, or help others do any of the following:

- **Harm to yourself or others**: This includes attempting to access another user’s account or private areas of the services, infringing on intellectual property or proprietary rights, exploiting, harassing, bullying, spamming, auto-messaging, or auto-dialing through our services.
- **Harm to WhiteMind**: This includes attempting to access or attack our systems, scraping our services without permission, transmitting viruses or malicious code, abusing or defrauding our payment systems, copying our products, using our intellectual property without consent, or misusing our reporting or customer service mechanisms.
- **Illegal activities**: This includes using the services to plan or commit any illegal activity.

We encourage you to report any content or behavior that violates these restrictions. You can learn more about our safety policies and content moderation by contacting us at **info@whitemind.net**.

## Termination

### Your Right to Terminate

You may stop using WhiteMind’s services at any time. To terminate this agreement, you can delete your WhiteMind account through the Settings page in the app or website and discontinue use of the services. Certain provisions of these terms will survive termination, as outlined in the **Survival** section.

Disabling your account limits the processing of your personal information as described in our **Privacy Policy**. However, disabling your account does **not** terminate this agreement.

### Our Right to Terminate

Subject to applicable law, we may suspend or terminate your account and/or restrict access to some or all of our services, with or without notice, at our discretion. Reasons for termination may include:

- Violation of these terms or other applicable policies.
- Compliance with a legal requirement or court order.
- A reasonable belief that termination is necessary to prevent harm to you, us, other users, or third parties.
- Inactivity for more than two years.
- A risk to WhiteMind, other users, or third parties if your account remains active.

If reasonable and legally required, we will provide advance notice before taking action.

## Appeals

We value transparency and strive to provide context for the decisions we make. If you believe an enforcement action—such as account termination, suspension, or content removal—was taken in error, you have the right to appeal.

To submit an appeal, contact us at **info@whitemind.net**. If you reside in the **European Economic Area (EEA)**, you must submit your appeal within **six months** of the decision.

## Indemnity

If you are using WhiteMind’s services on behalf of a business or legal entity, rather than in an individual capacity, you agree to **indemnify and hold harmless** WhiteMind, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, and costs (including reasonable legal and accounting fees) arising from:

- Your access to or use of our services.
- Your content.
- Your violation of these terms.

## Services “AS IS”

We strive to provide high-quality services, but we cannot guarantee everything. **TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WHITEMIND, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS MAKE NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SERVICES.** THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED **"AS IS."**

We specifically disclaim any **implied warranties** of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, and non-infringement, as well as any warranties arising from course of dealing or trade usage.

Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties. If these limitations are not enforceable under the laws of your jurisdiction, we limit the duration and remedies of such warranties to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## Data Charges

You are responsible for any mobile charges incurred while using our services, including data charges and fees for messaging services such as SMS, MMS, or other messaging technologies. If you are unsure about potential charges, please check with your mobile service provider before using our services.

## Limitation of Liability

We do not exclude or limit our liability where doing so would be illegal. In countries where the following exclusions are not permitted, we are responsible only for losses and damages that are a reasonably foreseeable result of our failure to use reasonable care and skill or a material breach of our contract with you. This does not affect consumer rights that cannot be waived or limited by any agreement.

The information provided through our services is for informational purposes only. We do not guarantee its accuracy, completeness, or usefulness. Any reliance on such information is at your own risk.

Where allowed by law, neither WhiteMind, its affiliates, nor its suppliers involved in creating, producing, or delivering the services will be liable, to the maximum extent permitted, for any incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost revenues, lost savings, loss of business opportunities, loss of data or goodwill, service interruptions, computer damage, system failure, or the cost of substitute services. This applies whether the claim is based on warranty, contract, statute, tort (including negligence), product liability, or any other legal theory, even if WhiteMind has been advised of the possibility of such damages. If a limited remedy outlined in these terms is found to have failed in its essential purpose, this limitation still applies.

Aside from liabilities that cannot be limited by law, WhiteMind's total liability to you is limited to the greater of (a) the amount you have paid us in the three months before making a claim, or (b) $100 USD (or the equivalent in your local currency).

WhiteMind is not responsible for the conduct or content—whether online or offline—of any user of our services.

These exclusions and limitations are fundamental elements of the agreement between WhiteMind and you. They apply fully to residents of New Jersey.

## Settling disputes between you and WhiteMind

### Informal Resolution

We believe that most disputes can be resolved without the need for formal legal action. If you have an issue with our services, we encourage you to reach out to us before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. To begin the informal resolution process, please send a **Written Notice** to **info@whitemind.net** that includes the following:

1. Your full name.
2. The email address or phone number associated with your WhiteMind account.
3. A detailed description of the issue.
4. A clear explanation of how you would like the issue to be resolved.

We will make a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute within **60 days** from the date we receive your Written Notice. During this period, both parties agree to engage in further informal discussions to reach a resolution. You must complete this informal resolution process before proceeding with formal dispute resolution, unless otherwise exempted by law.

Please note that, during this informal resolution process, **statutes of limitations** and **deadlines for arbitration filings** or other applicable deadlines will be paused upon our receipt of your Written Notice, as we work towards resolving the dispute.

#### Additional Information for EU Residents

If you reside in the **European Union**, you may also be entitled to submit your complaint through the **European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform** or the **Out-of-Court Dispute Settlement (OCDS)** mechanism under **DSA Article 21**. The ODR Platform allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to online purchases of goods and services without going to court.

However, please note that submitting a complaint via the ODR Platform or OCDS mechanism alone, without submitting the required Written Notice to **info@whitemind.net**, **will not toll** any applicable statutes of limitations or other filing deadlines.

### Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These terms, as well as any disputes related to them or our services, shall be governed by the **Federal Arbitration Act**, **federal arbitration law**, and the laws of the **State of California**, regardless of any conflict of laws rules.

Any dispute that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved exclusively in the **state** or **federal courts** located in **San Francisco County, California**. By agreeing to these terms, you and **WhiteMind** consent to the exclusive venue and personal jurisdiction of these courts.

#### Special Provision for EU Consumers

If you are a consumer residing in the **European Union**, this clause and these terms will not affect any mandatory consumer rights you may have under local law. In such cases, any disputes arising in connection with these services and/or terms shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in **Amsterdam, the Netherlands**. Alternatively, if you are a consumer in an EU Member State, you may submit the dispute to a court closer to your domicile.

### Agreement to Arbitrate

**IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT, PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT:**

You and **WhiteMind** agree that the **U.S. Federal Arbitration Act** governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.

Except for the circumstances outlined below, and only after both parties have engaged in a **good-faith** effort to resolve the dispute through the **informal resolution** process (described above), you and **WhiteMind** agree to resolve any dispute, disagreement, or claim related to these terms or our services through **final and binding arbitration**. This arbitration will take place in the U.S. county where you reside.

This agreement covers any claims, including those that arose before this arbitration agreement was made and claims that may arise after the termination of this agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions detailed in the following section.

### Arbitration Rules

The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by these terms and the **American Arbitration Association (AAA) Rules**, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions (the “AAA Rules”), available at [https://www.adr.org/active-rules](https://www.adr.org/active-rules). In case of a conflict between these terms and the AAA Rules, these terms will govern.

To begin the arbitration proceeding, either party must submit a written **Demand for Arbitration** (available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org)) to the AAA and provide a copy to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. To notify **WhiteMind**, please send an email with the subject line **“Arbitration Demand”** to [info@whitemind.net](mailto:info@whitemind.net).

#### Types of Arbitration Proceedings

- If the **amount in controversy** does not exceed **$10,000**, and you do not seek **injunctive** or **declaratory relief**, the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents submitted by both parties, unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is necessary.
- If the **amount in controversy exceeds $10,000**, or if **declaratory** or **injunctive relief** is sought, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing. The hearing may take place in-person, via videoconference, or by telephone.

### Arbitration Costs

AAA sets forth fees for its services, which are available at [www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Fee_Schedule.pdf](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Fee_Schedule.pdf).

- **If WhiteMind is the party initiating arbitration**: **WhiteMind** will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee.
- **If you initiate arbitration**: You will be responsible for the first **$100** toward the nonrefundable **Initial Filing Fee**, unless the arbitrator determines that you are unable to pay. In that case, **WhiteMind** will pay the entire filing fee.

  For cases seeking less than **$75,000**, **WhiteMind** will pay the remainder of the Initial Filing Fee and both parties’ administrative fees, unless the arbitrator determines your claims or defenses are frivolous or improper, in which case you will be responsible for the additional costs (as per **Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11**).

- **For cases seeking more than $75,000**, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.

#### Additional Costs

In all arbitrations, unless otherwise required by law or the AAA Rules, you will be responsible for any additional arbitration costs, including attorney’s fees and expert witness costs.

The parties agree that the AAA has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees as deemed appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase your costs. You waive any objection to such fee modification.

Both parties agree that a good-faith challenge to the fees imposed by the AAA does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this section while the challenge is pending before the AAA, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction.

### Offer of Judgment

At least **14 days** before the date set for an arbitration hearing, either party may serve an offer in writing upon the other party, allowing judgment on specified terms. If the offer made by the offering party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party will **not recover its post-offer costs** and will be required to pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer.

### Arbitration Decision

The decision of the arbitrator will be **in writing** and **binding** on you and **WhiteMind**, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any **court of competent jurisdiction**. You and **WhiteMind** agree that **dispositive motions** (motions that can resolve a case without a full hearing) will be allowed in the arbitration.

Except as explicitly set forth in this arbitration section, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have **exclusive authority** to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these terms of service. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Whether any part of these terms of service is void or voidable.
- Whether a claim is subject to arbitration.
- Any dispute regarding the payment of AAA or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment).

The arbitrator must follow these terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the **AAA Rules** and procedures for any frivolous or improper claims, claims submitted in bad faith, or a party's failure to comply with this section. Additionally, the arbitrator can sanction claims filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a party to this agreement.

No arbitration award or decision will have any **preclusive effect** on issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.

### Mass Filings

If, at any time, **30 or more similar demands for arbitration** are asserted against **WhiteMind** or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (“Mass Filing”), the following additional rules will apply:

If you or your counsel file a demand for arbitration that fits within the definition of a **Mass Filing**, you agree that your demand for arbitration will be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this section.

**Bellwether proceedings** are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators when multiple disputes involve similar claims against the same or related parties. You and **WhiteMind** agree to jointly request that the arbitrator follow these procedures:

1. The arbitrator will randomly assign sequential numbers to each of the claims included in a Mass Filing. The claims numbered **1-10** will be designated as the **“Initial Test Cases”** and will proceed to arbitration.
2. The Parties will agree on a **single arbitrator** for all Initial Test Cases, consolidating the cases for pre-hearing procedures and a pre-hearing conference.
3. Unless the claims are resolved in advance or the schedule is extended, the arbitrator will render final awards for the Initial Test Cases within **120 days** of the initial pre-hearing conference.
4. If fewer than **5 Initial Test Cases** resolve without a final decision (i.e., are resolved in advance), cases will be selected in batches of **10** and proceed to arbitration until at least **5 cases** have been resolved by a final arbitrator decision.
5. The arbitrator’s decisions for the Initial Test Cases shall be in writing and will contain the essential findings and conclusions of fact and law upon which the arbitrator based their decision.

The results of the Initial Test Cases resolved by a final arbitrator decision will then be provided to a **mediator**, who will attempt to facilitate a resolution for the remaining cases. After the results are provided to the mediator, the mediator and the parties will have **90 days** (the “**Mediation Period**”) to agree on a resolution or a substantive methodology for resolving the remaining cases. If the parties cannot resolve the claims during the Mediation Period, either party may opt-out of the arbitration process and proceed in court with their remaining claims. Notice of the opt-out must be provided in writing within **60 days** of the close of the Mediation Period.

Opting out of the arbitration process under this section does **not** constitute opting out of the **“Class Waiver”** section below.

If no opt-out notice is given, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to the claims in the Mass Filing.

If your demand for arbitration is part of the **Mass Filing**, any statute of limitations applicable to your claims will remain **tolled** (paused) until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or settled.

### Other Remedies

**ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.** In some cases, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation, and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. **YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND WHITEMIND ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.** You may, however, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you under your state’s law through arbitration.

### Opt-Out

You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing an opt-out notice to **info@whitemind.net** within **30 days** of **March 10, 2025**, or when you first register your **WhiteMind** account, whichever is later. If you do not opt out within this period, you shall be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, **WhiteMind** will also not be bound by them.

### Exceptions

You or **WhiteMind** may still pursue claims, if they qualify, exclusively in **small claims court** in **Munich, Germany**, and both you and **WhiteMind** consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in that court. The small claims court, and not any arbitrator or arbitration organization, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve disputes regarding whether a dispute is properly within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.

Additionally, disputes concerning **patents**, **copyrights**, **moral rights**, **trademarks**, **trade secrets**, and claims of **piracy** or **unauthorized use** of **WhiteMind's** services will not be subject to arbitration. Either party may also seek a **declaratory judgment** or other **equitable relief** in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed (and any applicable statute of limitations tolled) pending the outcome of such action.

### Class Waiver

**IF YOU’RE A RESIDENT OF THE U.S.**, except as provided herein, you and **WhiteMind** agree that each may bring claims against the other only in our **individual capacity**, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported **class** or **representative proceeding**, unless **WhiteMind** provides its consent to consolidate in writing. If this specific paragraph is found unenforceable, then the **“Agreement to Arbitrate”** section will be **null and void**.

If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.

This subsection does not prevent you or **WhiteMind** from participating in a **class-wide settlement** of claims.

### Changes to This Dispute Section

**WhiteMind** will provide **30 days'** notice of the date of any material changes to this clause. Changes will become effective on the **30th day** and apply to all claims not yet filed. If you continue to use the **WhiteMind** services after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which **WhiteMind** does not have actual notice are subject to the revised clause.

If you reject any such changes by opting out of the arbitration agreement, you may exercise your right to a **trial by jury** or **judge**, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the arbitration agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If **WhiteMind** changes this **“Dispute Resolution”** section after the date you first accepted this agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this agreement), you agree that your continued use of the **WhiteMind** product(s) or services **30 days** after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes.

If you do not agree to such change, you may opt out by providing notice as described in this section.
