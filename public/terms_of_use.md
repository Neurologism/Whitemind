Welcome to WhiteMind! We’re happy you’re here.

These terms set forth our legal obligations to each other. They apply to your use of our services.

When we say “WhiteMind,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these terms, we are referring to the owners of the WhiteMind service. <!-- we mean WhiteMind UG (haftungsbeschränkt) -->

When we say “services” in these terms, we mean WhiteMind’s services, including our website, apps, and other services that link to these terms.

When we say “you” or “your,” we mean you. If you’re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and “you” and “your” will refer to that entity.
