## How we use your information

Under certain data protection laws like GDPR, companies must have a “legal basis”—a valid reason—to process personal information. WhiteMind relies on different legal bases to process your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We use the information we collect—[Account Information](#account-information), [Content You Create](#content-you-create), [Payment Information](#payment-information), [Activity and Interaction](#activity-and-interaction), [Optional Features](#optional-features), [Customer Support and Feedback](#customer-support-and-feedback), [Device Information](#device-information), [Usage Information](#usage-information), [Referral and Advertising Data](#referral-and-advertising-data) and [Information We Receive from Other Sources](#information-we-receive-from-other-sources)—for the following reasons and in accordance with these legal bases. \
For each purpose, we explain why we process your information and how we use it to achieve that purpose.

### To Comply with Legal Obligations

We retain and process your information to comply with legal, regulatory, and auditing requirements. This includes retaining data for potential legal claims, responding to court orders, and verifying your identity when you exercise legal rights regarding your data.

## How we disclose your information

### When You Authorize Us

When you add content to the WhiteMind platform, we may share that information with other users based on your settings. For example, you can choose to make a project public or share it with specific collaborators.

If you link your account with a third-party service, embed content, or interact with third-party content on WhiteMind, we may provide certain information to that service or other WhiteMind users to enable the feature. Additionally, we may disclose your information as per your instructions or with your explicit consent.

### With Our Service Providers

We may share information with vendors who help us operate our services. This includes:

- **Payment processors** (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) that handle transactions on our behalf.

- **Cloud providers** that host our data and services.

- **Advertising platforms** to help us reach relevant audiences and measure ad performance. For example, we may share limited information, such as the fact that you registered on WhiteMind, to improve marketing effectiveness.

We provide only the necessary information required to facilitate these services and ensure vendors comply with applicable privacy protections.

### To Comply with Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if required by law, including for law enforcement or national security purposes. Where possible and legally permitted, we will attempt to notify you before making such disclosures.

### In Emergency Situations

If we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to prevent serious harm to a person, we may share relevant information to mitigate the risk.

### To Enforce Our Policies and Protect Rights

We may disclose information if necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or other policies. This includes situations where disclosure is required to protect our rights, property, users, or the general public.

### In Business Transfers

If WhiteMind undergoes a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of the transaction. We will take steps to ensure continued protection of your data and notify you if your personal information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

### Aggregated or De-Identified Data

We may share information that has been aggregated or anonymized in a way that prevents it from being used to identify you. For example, we might publish user statistics to describe our services, demonstrate trends, or highlight product features to partners and the public.

By using WhiteMind, you acknowledge that your data may be shared as described above.

## Data retention

We retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. This includes providing services, resolving disputes, enforcing our policies, and complying with legal obligations. When we no longer need your data, we securely delete or anonymize it.

---

## How we protect your information

We take extensive measures to safeguard your information. All data transmitted within our services is encrypted using HTTPS and Transport Layer Security (TLS) to prevent unauthorized access.

Our systems are continuously monitored for vulnerabilities and potential threats, and we conduct regular security assessments to uphold the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. Additionally, we implement industry best practices to reinforce our security framework and proactively address emerging risks.

## How to Control Your Privacy

We believe that every WhiteMind user should have the ability to customize their experience, including their privacy preferences. While local laws may impose different requirements, we strive to provide all users with a consistent set of privacy controls, regardless of location. Below, you’ll find details on how to manage your data, delete or correct information, and request access to your data. Users in certain regions may have additional rights under local laws—these are outlined in the relevant sections below.

### Disable or Delete Your Account

You can delete your account at any time via the **User Settings** menu. This action permanently removes identifying information and anonymizes other associated data.

- **Created Content**: Edit or delete projects, files, and other content you've generated within WhiteMind.
- **Payment Information**: Modify or remove stored payment methods.

## International Data Transfers

WhiteMind is based in Germany, and we process and store information on servers located in Germany. However, depending on various factors—including the locations of our users and service providers—we may also store and process data on servers and equipment in other countries. These international data transfers enable us to provide our services efficiently.

By accessing or using our services, or by providing information to us, you acknowledge that your data may be processed, transferred, and stored in Germany and other countries. These jurisdictions may have different data protection laws than your country of residence, and your rights under local law may not be the same.

### Data Transfers Outside the EEA

When transferring personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we rely on the following safeguards:

- **[Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&from=EN)** (Module 1 and Module 2) approved by the European Commission.
- **[Adequacy Decisions](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en)** issued by the European Commission for certain countries.
- Other legally recognized mechanisms to ensure compliance with data protection laws.

### Compliance with Data Privacy Frameworks

WhiteMind complies with the **EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks**, as well as the **UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework**. These frameworks provide a legal basis for transferring personal data from the EU, Switzerland, and the UK to the United States.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our compliance with the Data Privacy Framework principles, you can contact us at **info@whitemind.net**. If we are unable to resolve your complaint, you may submit it free of charge to **[JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield)**, an independent dispute resolution provider.

Under certain conditions specified in the Data Privacy Framework principles, you may have the right to invoke **binding arbitration** for unresolved disputes. WhiteMind is also subject to the **investigatory and enforcement powers** of the **German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (BfDI)**.

In specific cases, WhiteMind may be held liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland, or the UK to third parties outside those regions. If there is any conflict between this privacy policy and the **EU-U.S. or Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles**, the **Principles shall govern**.
