We want to ensure you understand your rights and choices regarding your personal data. By using our services, you agree to the practices outlined in this policy. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at **info@whitemind.net**.

## Information We Collect

We collect various types of information when you use WhiteMind. This includes information you provide to us, data we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources.

For each purpose, we explain why we process your information and how we use it to achieve that purpose.

### To Protect Vital Interests

If necessary, we may process or share personal data to protect someone’s life or safety—for example, in an emergency medical situation.

By using WhiteMind, you acknowledge that your data is processed in accordance with these principles.

3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e.legal basis) to do so
under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to
protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.

If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your
personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

      Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e.consent) to use your personal information for a specific
      purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.

      Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary tofulfil our contractual obligations
      to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.

      Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business
      interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your
      personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:

            Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services

            Analyse how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users

            Support our marketing activities

            Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities

            Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience

      Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to
      cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in
      litigation in which we are involved.

Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a
third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e.express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for
example:

      If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way

      For investigations and fraud detection and prevention

      For business transactions provided certain conditions are met

      If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim

      For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin

      If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse

      If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
      collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a
      province

      If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records

      If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the
      purposes for which the information was produced

      If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes

      If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.

We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

      assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services.
Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your
preferences, and assist with basic site functions.

We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to
help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on
your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services
tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.

To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a 'sale'/'sharing' (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the
applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below
under section 'DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?'

Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.

7. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?

In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.

Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where
you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may
vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as
other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.
We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the
relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social
media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and
how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention
period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete oranonymise such information, or,
if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system oforganisational and technical security measures.

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will
do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only
access the Services within a secure environment.

10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

In Short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK),
Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information.You may review, change, or
terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.

the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of
your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances,
you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the

your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.

Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,which may be express and/or implied consent
depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting
us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the
processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU

11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate
to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform
technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
