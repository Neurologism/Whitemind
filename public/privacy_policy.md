- Using **WhiteMind**, our AI-powered platform for learning, prototyping, collaboration, and innovation.

We want to ensure you understand your rights and choices regarding your personal data. By using our services, you agree to the practices outlined in this policy. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us at **info@whitemind.net**.

## Information We Collect

We collect various types of information when you use WhiteMind. This includes information you provide to us, data we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources.

### Information You Provide to Us

#### Account Information

When you create a WhiteMind account, you provide a username, password, and contact details (such as an email address or phone number). In some cases, we may require additional information to verify your age or account. You may also choose to add a display name or other optional profile details.

#### Content You Create

This includes any content you upload, share, or create using WhiteMind, including profile information, shared files, and projects you develop.

#### Payment Information

If you purchase paid services through WhiteMind, you may need to provide payment details such as a valid payment method, full name, and billing address. Payments are processed through third-party providers like Stripe and PayPal. Depending on the processor, we may receive limited billing details, such as the last four digits of your credit card number.

We collect data about how you use WhiteMind, including the users you interact with, projects you create, models you train, and purchases you make. You can control the extent of this data collection as described in the **“How to Control Your Privacy”** section.

Some features require additional information or permissions to function. This includes third-party integrations and the data you choose to share with us from those services.

If you contact WhiteMind Support or participate in surveys, we collect any information you provide as part of those interactions.

### Information We Collect Automatically

#### Device Information

We collect data about the device you use to access WhiteMind, such as your IP address, operating system, browser type, and device settings.

By using WhiteMind, you agree to the collection of this information as outlined above.

## How we use your information

Under certain data protection laws like GDPR, companies must have a “legal basis”—a valid reason—to process personal information. WhiteMind relies on different legal bases to process your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We use the information we collect—[Account Information](#account-information), [Content You Create](#content-you-create), [Payment Information](#payment-information), [Activity and Interaction](#activity-and-interaction), [Optional Features](#optional-features), [Customer Support and Feedback](#customer-support-and-feedback), [Device Information](#device-information), [Usage Information](#usage-information), [Referral and Advertising Data](#referral-and-advertising-data) and [Information We Receive from Other Sources](#information-we-receive-from-other-sources)—for the following reasons and in accordance with these legal bases. \
For each purpose, we explain why we process your information and how we use it to achieve that purpose.

### To Comply with Legal Obligations

We retain and process your information to comply with legal, regulatory, and auditing requirements. This includes retaining data for potential legal claims, responding to court orders, and verifying your identity when you exercise legal rights regarding your data.

## How we disclose your information

### When You Authorize Us

When you add content to the WhiteMind platform, we may share that information with other users based on your settings. For example, you can choose to make a project public or share it with specific collaborators.

If you link your account with a third-party service, embed content, or interact with third-party content on WhiteMind, we may provide certain information to that service or other WhiteMind users to enable the feature. Additionally, we may disclose your information as per your instructions or with your explicit consent.

### With Our Service Providers

We may share information with vendors who help us operate our services. This includes:

- **Payment processors** (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) that handle transactions on our behalf.

- **Cloud providers** that host our data and services.

- **Advertising platforms** to help us reach relevant audiences and measure ad performance. For example, we may share limited information, such as the fact that you registered on WhiteMind, to improve marketing effectiveness.

We provide only the necessary information required to facilitate these services and ensure vendors comply with applicable privacy protections.

### To Comply with Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if required by law, including for law enforcement or national security purposes. Where possible and legally permitted, we will attempt to notify you before making such disclosures.

### In Emergency Situations

If we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to prevent serious harm to a person, we may share relevant information to mitigate the risk.

### To Enforce Our Policies and Protect Rights

We may disclose information if necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or other policies. This includes situations where disclosure is required to protect our rights, property, users, or the general public.

### In Business Transfers

If WhiteMind undergoes a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of the transaction. We will take steps to ensure continued protection of your data and notify you if your personal information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

### Aggregated or De-Identified Data

We may share information that has been aggregated or anonymized in a way that prevents it from being used to identify you. For example, we might publish user statistics to describe our services, demonstrate trends, or highlight product features to partners and the public.

By using WhiteMind, you acknowledge that your data may be shared as described above.
