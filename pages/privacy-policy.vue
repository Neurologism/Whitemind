    personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to
    process your personal information:<br />

    to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to
    entering into a contract with you.<br />
    <br />
    Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is
    reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business<br />
    interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental
    rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your<br />

    necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to<br />
    cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or
    defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in<br />
    litigation in which we are involved.<br />
    Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is
    necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a<br />
    third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of
    any person.<br />
    <br />
    If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    We may process your information if you have given us specific permission
    (i.e.express consent) to use your personal information for a specific<br />
    purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.
    implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law
    to process your information without your consent, including, for<br />
    example:<br />
    <br />
    If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
    cannot be obtained in a timely way<br />
    <br />
    For investigations and fraud detection and prevention<br />
    <br />
    For business transactions provided certain conditions are met<br />
    <br />
    If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to
    assess, process, or settle an insurance claim<br />
    <br />
    For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with
    next of kin<br />
    <br />
    If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may
    be victim of financial abuse<br />
    <br />
    If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
    compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the<br />
    collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of
    an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a<br />
    province<br />
    <br />
    If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order,
    or rules of the court relating to the production of records<br />
    <br />
    If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
    business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the<br />
    purposes for which the information was produced<br />
    <br />
    If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary
    purposes<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    <br />
    Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
    third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins).
    Where<br />
    you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you

    vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often

    as<br />
    other information you choose to make public on such a social media
    platform.<br />
    We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
    described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on
    the<br />
    relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
    responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party
    social<br />
    media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to
    understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information,
    and<br />
    how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.<br />

    retention<br />
    period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other

    your<br />
    personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have

    <br />
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal

    information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
    secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or<br />
    information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
    cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other<br />
    unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
    improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we
    will<br />

    information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only<br />
    access the Services within a secure environment.<br />

    11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
    include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate<br />
    to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
    browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform<br />
    technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been
    finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser<br />
    signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
    not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted<br />
    that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
    a revised version of this Privacy Notice.<br />
    <br />
    California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT
    signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal<br />
    standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them
    at this time.<br />
