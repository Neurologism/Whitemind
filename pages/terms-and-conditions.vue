  The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
  distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country

  locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for
  compliance<br />

  The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations

  <br />
  16. TERM AND TERMINATION<br />
  These Legal Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the

  TERMS, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR
  LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE<br />
  SERVICES (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
  REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT<br />

  pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />

  suspension,<br />
  or discontinuance of the Services.<br />
  <br />
  We cannot guarantee the Services will be available at all times. We may
  experience hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform
  maintenance<br />
  related to the Services, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. We
  reserve the right to change, revise, update, suspend, discontinue, or

  to obligate us to maintain and support the Services or to supply any
  corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  18. GOVERNING LAW<br />
  These Legal Terms are governed by and interpreted following the laws of
  Germany, and the use of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the<br />
  International Sales of Goods is expressly excluded. If your habitual residence
  is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the
  protection<br />
  provided to you by obligatory provisions of the law in your country to
  residence. WhiteMind UG(haftungsbeschraenkt) and yourself both agree to submit
  to<br />
  the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Bavaria, which means that you
  may make a claim to defend your consumer protection rights in regards to
  these<br />
  Legal Terms in Germany, or in the EU country in which you reside.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION<br />
  <br />
  Informal Negotiations<br />
  <br />
  To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or
  claim related to these Legal Terms (each a 'Dispute' and collectively, the<br />
  'Disputes') brought by either you or us (individually, a 'Party' and
  collectively, the 'Parties'), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate
  any Dispute (except<br />
  those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30)
  days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence
  upon<br />
  written notice from one Party to the other Party.<br />
  <br />
  Binding Arbitration<br />
  <br />
  Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to these Legal
  Terms shall be determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in
  accordance<br />
  with the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of Arbitration
  being part of the European Centre of Arbitration having its seat in
  Strasbourg, and<br />
  which are in force at the time the application for arbitration is filed, and
  of which adoption of this clause constitutes acceptance. The seat of
  arbitration shall be<br />
  Munich, Germany. The language of the proceedings shall be German. Applicable
  rules of substantive law shall be the law of Germany.<br />
  <br />
  Restrictions<br />
  <br />
  The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between
  the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no
  arbitration shall<br />
  be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for
  any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilise class
  action<br />
  procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
  brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public
  or any<br />
  other persons.<br />
  <br />
  Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration<br />
  <br />
  The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above
  provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any
  Disputes<br />
  seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the
  intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or
  arising from,<br />
  allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorised use; and
  (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal
  or<br />
  unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling
  within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
  such<br />
  Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the
  courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
  personal<br />
  jurisdiction of that court.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  20. CORRECTIONS<br />
  <br />
  There may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors,
  inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability,
  and<br />
  various other information. We reserve the right to correct any errors,
  inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update the information on the
  Services at<br />
  any time, without prior notice.<br />
  <br />
  <br />

  MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  23. INDEMNIFICATION<br />
  You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless, including our
  subsidiaries, affiliates, and all of our respective officers, agents,

  this<br />
  indemnification upon becoming aware of it.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  24. USER DATA<br />

  purpose of managing the performance of the Services, as well as data relating
  to your<br />

  are solely responsible for all data that you transmit or that relates to
  any<br />
  activity you have undertaken using the Services. You agree that we shall have
  no liability to you for any loss or corruption of any such data, and you
  hereby<br />
  waive any right of action against us arising from any such loss or corruption

  26. MISCELLANEOUS<br />
  These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the
  Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire agreement and<br />
  understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right
  or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such
  right<br />
  or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by
  law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any
  time.<br />
  We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure
  to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or
  part<br />
  of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or
  unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable
  from<br />
  these Legal Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any
  remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or<br />
  agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Legal
  Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not be<br />
  construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any
  and all defences you may have based on the electronic form of these Legal<br />
  Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal
  Terms.<br />
